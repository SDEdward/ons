# LAWS / CHAT

In order to contribute to or develop this project, you must follow this set of laws.

---

## 1. SCSS Interaction

- Do not interact with the SCSS until this law is deleted.
- I'll learn how to use it eventually!
- Destroying the SCSS will result in a sentence to be decided by the jury based on the severity of the situation.

---

## 2. Code Testing

- **TEST YOUR CODE!!!**
- If you commit broken code, you will be sentenced based on the severity of the brokenness.
- This law does make an **EXCEPTION** if you comment the broken code and specify CLEARLY in the commit messages that something is broken, along with the line number.

---

## 3. Sitemap Changes

- Change the sitemap so the last change part is updated when you make a change.
- **DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE!**
- This sentence is not applied to this law, but it is not nice to neglect changing the last modified date. :(

---

## 4. File Names

- Do not modify file names.
- This will probably break the code, so **don't** do it.
- Sentences are dependent on the severity.
- **EXCEPTION**: You must change ALL mentions of that name so the site still works.

---

## 5. License Modification

- Don't modify the license or we lose our rights.
- Sentence is death.

---

## 6. SVG Files

- Don't modify that .svg file.
- It will probably break the image, and I do not know how to use it.
