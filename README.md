# Ons - Our New Site

Welcome to **Ons**, a revamped version of our original project, **Lil Passion Project**. We've taken the time to enhance the user experience and ensure compatibility across a wider range of devices.

## Why the Change?

The original **Lil Passion Project** faced significant issues on devices with resolutions other than 1920x1080p and was primarily optimized for Google Chrome. To provide a better experience for all users, we decided to rewrite the code from the ground up. Our goal is to create a more accessible and responsive site that works seamlessly across various devices and browsers.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works well on all major browsers, not just Google Chrome.
- **Improved Performance**: Faster load times and smoother interactions for a better user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with **Ons**, simply follow the instructions in the setup guide.
