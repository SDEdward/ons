# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone who participates in our project. We believe that diversity enriches our community and enhances our work.

## Our Standards

To keep our community friendly and productive, we expect all participants to adhere to the following standards:

1. **Be Respectful**: Treat everyone with kindness and respect. Personal attacks, harassment, or discriminatory comments will not be tolerated.

2. **Be Inclusive**: We welcome people from all backgrounds and experiences. Be open to different perspectives and ideas.

3. **Be Supportive**: Help others when you can. If someone asks for help, offer your support and guidance.

4. **Be Constructive**: When providing feedback, focus on the issue, not the person. Aim to be helpful and constructive in your comments.

5. **Be Mindful**: Remember that everyone is here to learn and grow. Be patient and understanding with others.

6. **No politics**: Noone wants to hear your opinion.

## Swearing

Swearing gets a separate section cause it is allowed but not slurs or against someone (in our team).

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to me (SDEdward) or support@safacpealdraq.eu . We take these matters seriously and will address them promptly.

## Consequences

Participants who violate this Code of Conduct may be warned, temporarily suspended, or permanently banned from the project, depending on the severity of the behavior.
